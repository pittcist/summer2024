## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### A general rule of Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight language that we can use to add formatting elements to plaintext documents.

*Note: adding two spaces at the end of line to break the line*

Superscript: x^2^  
Subscript: H~2~O  
Strikethrough: ~~deleted~~  

# Heading 1  
## Heading 2  
### Heading 3  
#### Heading 4  
##### Heading 5  
###### Heading 6  

### Blockquote

> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. This is the first paragraph.  
> This is  the second paragraph.

### Lists

Ordered list (numbers don't matter)

1. Level 1 First Item  
    1. Level 2 First Item  
    1. Level 2 Second Item  
1. Level 1 Second Item   

Unordered list (must leave an empty line before the lsit)

- Level 1 First Item  
    - Level 2 First Item  
    - Level 2 Second Item  
- Level 1 Second Item 

### Task List

- [ ] Something to do  
- [ ] Something else to do  
- [x] Something already done  

### Inline code block

In C language, we use the `printf();` function to output results.

### Code block
```{r}
print("hello world")
```

### LaTex math chunks

$$
\alpha + \beta = \gamma
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{x^2 \pm 4ac}{y^2}

$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n i
$$

### R vectors and calculation

```{r}
a <- c(1,3,5,7,9)
b = c(2,4,6,8,10)

a
b

a * 2
b / 2

s = a ** 2
s
```

### R range

```{r}
1:10
v = c(1:10)
v

# sequence = seq(1, 100, 0.2)
# sequence

# repeat a given number of times
a_repeated = rep(a, 5)
a_repeated

# repeat until a given length
a_length = rep(a, l=18)
a_length

```
### R arithmetic operators

Modulus (x mod y)  

x %% y (get the remainder of a division)

Integer division 

x %/% y (division between two integers)

```{r}
7 %% 2

7 %/% 2
```

### R logical operators

AND: &  (either part is zero, the result is zero)
OR: |  (either part is one, the result is one)
NOT: ! (flip between zero and one)

Equal to: ==   (double equal signs)
Not equal to: !=

```{r}
a
v = a > 5
v

a[v]
a[!v]
```
```{r}
mean(a) # average (mean)
sd(a) # standard divation

max(a)
min(a)
sum(a) # summation
sqrt(a) # square roots
range(a)

```
### Missing values (not available, NA)
 
```{r}
ds = c(1,2,NA, NA, NA, 6)
ds
mean(ds)

is.na(ds)

mean(ds[!is.na(ds)])
```

### Filtering and slicing
```{r}
mtcars

mtcars$mpg
mtcars$cyl

mtcars[1,]
mtcars[,1]

# filter by cyl

mtcars$cyl == 4
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4,]

mtcars[mtcars$mpg <30, ]
```

### R strings

```{r}
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "World"

paste(s1, s2)
paste0(s1,s2)

paste(s1, sep=", ", s2)
```

### R loops

```{r}
for(i in c(1:10))
{
  print(i)
}

```
### R matrix

```{r}
sports = c("football", "baseball", "basketball")
leagues = c("FIFA", "MLB", "NBA")

max_sports = cbind(sports, leagues)
max_sports

max_sports = rbind(sports, leagues)
max_sports

max = matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)
max

# transpose
max_t = t(max)
max_t
```

### R Plotting

```{r}
mtcars
x = mtcars$cyl
y = mtcars$mpg

plot(x,y)

# Sin() curve
x = seq(-2*pi, 2*pi, 0.01)
y = sin(x)

plot(x, y, col = "red")

```
