## Course Syllabus - Intro to Data Analytics in R and Python 

**Summer 2024 (July 8-11, 2024, 08:00-12:00, Beijing Standard Time**)

### Course Description

Welcome to the Intro to Data Analytics course in R and Python, Summer 2024. This course will be taught online via Zoom Meeting from **July 8-11, 2024, 8:00-12:00 BJT**.   

This course is designed for upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students in business programs with a strong interest in data analytics. This course will introduce concepts, tools, and methods related to data collection, cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization for business operations. Students in this class will benefit from the hands-on teaching style and real-world cases and examples.  

Topics of this course include: markdown (a lightweight markup language), the software package R, R statistical methods, Python programming language, Python web handling, regular expression and other data analytics-related tools and topics. This course is intended for students who plan to seek data analytics-related jobs or apply for graduate schools in information systems and/or data sciences. Students who wish to improve academic research skills may also benefit from this course.  

This course will be taught synchronously on **Zoom** each day in the morning. Please use the provided Zoom link and passcode to join the class sessions.  

### Language

Per university policies, the primary instructional language of this course is **English**.  

This course requires intensive English reading and writing. All course materials are given in English. Students are expected to complete writing assignments in English. Students are encouraged to participate in class discussions in English. 

### Canvas Enrollment

The course LMS (learning management system) is **Canvas** by Instructure. All course materials, including assignment and grade management will be hosted on Canvas. 

All students should self-enroll on Canvas prior to July 8. The enrollment link is: **https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/MA9AJE** 

### Prerequisite

Although students are not required to have a computer programming background, at least one intro-level programming course and one college-level statistics course prior to taking this course will be very helpful.

***This is an intensive coding class***. We'll spend the majority of time on hands-on coding practices. All students **MUST** bring a personal computer. If you are running Zoom on a tablet, a separate personal computer may be needed for coding. 

Running Zoom on a mobile phone is NOT recommended because the small screen makes it difficult to view the code clearly.

Please follow the enclosed instructions to install the required software on your computer, including:

- Visual Studio Code
- R
- R Studio
- Python
- PyCharm (optional)

Please have the above software packages installed on your computer before our first day of class.

### Course Conduct and Policies 

#### Attendance Policy

Attendance is required, and attendance policy will be strictly enforced in compliance with the university policies.

#### Homework/Assignment Policy

Completed homework/assignment must be turned in by the due time as specified in the assignment requirements. No late homework/assignment will be accepted.

#### Make-up Policy

There will be no make-up assignment except in the case of a documented medical emergency.

#### Grading

Students enrolled in this course will receive a grade of either S (Satisfactory) or F (Fail). To earn an S, students must accumulate over 60% of the available credits. Those who do not meet this threshold will receive an F.

#### Professionalism

Students who are uncooperative, rude, and abusive to the instructor or other students will be penalized. Students who habitually show up late, or leave early without appropriate permission, bring food or drink into classrooms, read papers or magazines irrelevant to class instructions, listen to music, or use cell phones during class, use computers in class for anything other than approved class-related activities, or are disruptive in any other way, will be penalized.

#### Academic Integrity

Students are expected to uphold the standard of conduct relating to academic integrity. An individual student is assumed full responsibility for the content and integrity of the academic work he or she submits. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall be that a student’s submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be his or her own work.  

All sources must be cited with full references. **Copying ideas, code, and writings from another person and presenting them as if one’s own is plagiarism**. Any form of cheating and plagiarism uncovered will result in an immediate F for that assignment and may lead to a discussion of the situation with the disciplinary officials assigned by the university.

#### Disability Policy

Students with a disability may request an accommodation as early as possible in the term. The instructor will accept verified disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.
